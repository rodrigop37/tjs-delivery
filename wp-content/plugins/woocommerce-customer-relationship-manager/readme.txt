Easily manage your customers and leads who purchase through your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==
Allows for an overview management of customers and their related accounts as well as managing the communication between your store and them.

= Add / Edit Customers =
Adding customers has never been easier, simply click on the 'Add Customer' button and fill the required fields you need to fill. There are extra fields added by default, however you can add more fields using the free [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin.

= Customer Status =
Manage your customers effectively using the default customer statuses which can be assigned in bulk or individually from the customer profile. Choose out of:

* Favourite
* Blocked
* Flagged
* Follow-up
* Prospect
* Lead
* Customer

= Import & Export =
Filter through your customers as you like and export the filtered result into CSV for other usage. This plugin also supports importing of customers using a mapping approach where you can map CSV fields to the existing fields.

= Existing Customers =
This plugin works instantly without needing to import your WooCommerce orders / customers. On first install, this plugin will load the customers into the CRM database. By default, the customer status of a customer who makes a purchase through your store is 'Customer'.

= Sending Emails =
Send emails to each customer individually or in bulk. These emails then appear under the customers activity for better management of communication.

= Place Calls =
Make phone calls using the default tel: client on your computer e.g. Microsoft Communicator, Skype or FaceTime. When placing the phone call, you can log the necessary information such as related information, duration of the call and purpose of the call.

= Customer Notes =
Similar to the order notes function within WooCommerce, you can also take customer notes for each customer to remember the important things for future use.

= Integrations =
This plugin is compatible with the following plugins:

* [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
* [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
* [Groups for WooCommerce](https://www.woothemes.com/products/groups-woocommerce/)
